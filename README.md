# Markdown to Jira

https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1bO

Jira is ridiculous, just use markdown, and also have a ext editor that doesn't erase all my work as soon as I accidentally click away from the text field. In place of a decent editing experience, this action lets me write markdown text in drafts, convert to JIRA formatting and then place it on the clipboard.

If the action is run as is then the whole body of the draft is copied, if you only want to convert a portion of the text in the active draft, select it and then run the action.

## Requirements

This script is meant for use with the excellent [Drafts Mac/iOS application](https://getdrafts.com). The script can be installed either through downloading and opening the `Copy as Jira.draftsAction` file from this repo, or installing from the [Drafts Directory](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1bO).

## Acknowledgements

This uses an excerpt from Fokke Zandbergen's [J2M](https://github.com/FokkeZB/J2M), that I [forked](https://github.com/AlexJHayward/J2M) and made a small adjustment to in order to better format numbered lists.
